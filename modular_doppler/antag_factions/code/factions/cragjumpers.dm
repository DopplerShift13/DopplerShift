	description = "When the working man is sufficiently pressed, the consequences are sometimes explosive. The Crag Jumpers are a blue collar union of 'less-than-licensed' miners trawling the belts and moons in the vicinity of the Nine Lives Promenade, and are not thrilled with the sudden encroachment upon their 'claims' brought by the presence of a new Port Authority vessel.\n\n\
	Armed with a litany of Xion-era mining tools previously outlawed for their awful safety record and a wide array of industrial explosives, they're certain to make their ire known with a bang."
