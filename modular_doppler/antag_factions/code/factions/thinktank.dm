	description = "A group of greys from a mothership, collaborating on one of their many esoteric projects; From evaluating how many brains can fit in a moth's body, to engineering fruit that meets every nutritional need in one bite, no field of science is spared from a think-tank's purview.\n\n\
	However, samples, materials and even control data do not come idly. To reduce their workload and maximize research time, think-tanks often hire or brainwash capable individuals.\n\n\
	Additionally, think-tanks have attracted a cult of personality in recent years. Conspiracy theorists and scientific fanatics who come upon a discarded piece of Grey technology often become obssessed, performing criminal acts to gain an audience with the elusive faction."
