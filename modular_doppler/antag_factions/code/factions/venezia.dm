Mapping the genome of several obscure species, they were able to stand out from the crowd. A series of innovative marketing campaigns elevated their designer gene-mods into displays of high status. Today, a sizable media empire backs their unique brand of exotic treatements. \
	However, pushing boundaries is not done without a fuss. Indeed, Venezia is relentless in it's pursuit of acquiring anything from new species to unique samples. From their conception, they've employed all manner of agents to stay on top of any medical and genetic advancements, through subterfuge, force and always proxies."
