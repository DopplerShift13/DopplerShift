notes on how to translate...

feel free to ignore mutant_styles on build_worn_icons, it doesnt do anything important


generate_custom_worn_icon

		// SKYRAT EDIT ADDITION
		if(!mutant_override)
			my_chest?.worn_belt_offset?.apply_offset(belt_overlay)
		// SKYRAT EDIT END

we're not doing this right now but check if it fails to render properly - do we need to abort the sprite offset if we autogen
custom_worn_icons is important

check greyscale_config_worn_teshari when youre filling in premade sprites! worn_icon_teshari too

cahnge the name of the fallback gen sprite to not be a fallback

need to add
				if (shape != BODYSHAPE_HUMANOID)
					found_alt_shape = TRUE

to all human_update_icons procs... the chec that discludes bodyshapehumanoid
    maybe check to see if  the icon state actually exists in the target, and if not, skip...
    if so. use icon_states_fast


many sprites arent used bc they were updated to gags and the tesh sprite is NOT g ags
