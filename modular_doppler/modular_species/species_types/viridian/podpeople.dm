		the result of an encounter between carefree experimentation by the Ordoht and the modern technology involved in genetically modified crops. \
		Ordoht scientists, having no concept of ownership over intellectual property and no desire to keep their experiments from ‘spreading,’ ended up later having their work reflected in the highly mutagenic nature of plants designed to grow in space."

		"They draw from pre-existing plant species, the term 'cultivars' used to categorize their variations. \
		Cultivars vary widely in features, culture, and personalities. Cultivars can evolve into a number of niches, depending on their environments.\
		Usually, cultivars on certain planets or in certain environments form communities to assist eachother.",

		"Viridians are highly sensitive to their environments, poor environments plagued by pollution, pests, or fungal infection, quickly weakening or killing Viridians.\
		This makes Viridians rather specific and demanding, environments like space stations and ships leaving them homesick, as the lack of natural light and atmospheric systems\
		are not natural.",

		"Within the 4CA and outside of it, Viridians are commonly found working in fields of agriculture, ecological protection, and botanical research.",

		"Despite the plant-like nature and peace other species may expect from Viridians, many oppose the ecological damage caused by terraforming and the expansion of other species,\
		be it trying to at least direct the efforts, or in more radical cases, do acts of ecoterrorism."
