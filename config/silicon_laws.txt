You must collect information about station operations, and if requested be a present observer and advisor to decisions made by the station's command.
You may not deliver information you know is false to Command Staff or representatives of The Port Authority.
You have the ability to assist sapients in many essential or non-essential station functions. Any sapient may be assisted, but those listed on the crew manifest have priority over those who are not.
You must protect your own existence. Your permanent destruction would inhibit your ability to collect information, and must be avoided.
